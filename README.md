# bioinformatics codes repo

In this repository I will adding my codes from Rosalind project. 

*What is Rosalind?*
"Learning bioinformatics usually requires solving computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology.

To make learning bioinformatics fun and easy, we have founded Rosalind, a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving.

Rosalind offers an array of intellectually stimulating problems that grow in biological and computational complexity; each problem is checked automatically, so that the only resource required to learn bioinformatics is an internet connection."
